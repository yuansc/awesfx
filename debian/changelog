awesfx (0.5.0b-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer. Closes: #235271.
  * New upstream release.
  * Upstream is now using automake/autoconf, debian/rules is
    changed accordingly.
  * Upstream now has ALSA support, Build-Depends is changed
    accordingly.
  * Upstream is now installing banks into /usr/share/sounds/sf2,
    not /usr/lib/sfbank. debian/rules, /etc/sfxload, and others
    are changed accordingly.
  * Manually install libawe.a since upstream makefiles don't anymore.
    Not sure if anyone needs it, but better safe than sorry.
  * Merged useful README information from unofficial awesfx 0.5.0a
    package by Nicos Panayides into README.Debian.
  * And honorary mention to Darren Salt for keeping awesfx 0.4.4
    available on the web (although this package was based on the
    official 0.4.4-5 package found on snapshot.debian.net, not on
    his 0.4.4-6 package).
