* CONTENTS

This directory contains some samples of virtual bank files.

[Bank Files for 512k DRAM]
default-2m.bnk 	- bank file for dynamic loading of GS sounds
	Use this file with --dynamic option of drvmidi.
	2mbgmgs.sf2 font is used except footsteps sound.
	synthgs.sbk is used only for footsteps instead.

xgdefault.bnk	- bank file for dynamic loading of GS/XG sounds
	Use this file together with --dynamic and --xgmap=on.
	This file includes the other three XG mapping files below.
	You'll need to install all the files.

[Bank File for 8MB DRAM]
emu8m.bnk	- bank file for 8mbgmsfx.sf2 from Emu
	This file includes GS instruments from 2mbgmgs.sf2, and
	XG mapping files.  The whole file can be loaded on 8MB DRAM.

ch12msup.bnk	- bank file for chaos12m.sf2 from Chaos
	For dynamic loading 12MB fonts on 8MB DRAM.
	This file includes chaos8m.sf2 font for some GS parts.
	The XG mapping files must be also installed.

[Bank Files for XG mapping]
xgsfx.bnk 	- bank file for XG SFX kit
	Many preset mappings are defined on this file for XG SFX
	sounds.  Use this file with --xgmap=on option of drvmidi.
	If this option is enabled, bank #64 and #126 are used as
	XG SFX banks.

xgdrum.bnk	- bank file for XG Drum kit	
	Many preset mappings are defined on this file for XG Drum
	sounds.  Use this file with --xgmap=on option of drvmidi.
	If this option is enabled, from drumset #64 to #126 are used
	for XG drum sounds.

xgmap.bnk	- bank file for XG mapping
	Just including both two files above.


* HOW TO PLAY XG MIDI FILES

- Copy all the bank files above to the soundfont bank directory,
  as default, /usr/local/lib/sfbank or /dos/sb32/sfbank.
  The default bank directory is defined in awelib/config.h.
  If you'll use another GS soundfont, specify it in default.bnk.

- If you have only 512k DRAM on the soundcard, use dynamic loading.
  Set the default options of drvmidi in ~/.drvmidirc as follows:

	default --xgmap=on --dynamic=xgdefault.bnk

  xgdefault.bnk contains both GS/GM fonts and XG mappings.

  Otherwise, if you have enough DRAM, you can load all the fonts at
  once on the driver.  Then, set --xgmap option only in the default
  option of drvmidi,

	default --xgmap=on
  
- Load the font file before starting tkmidi or drvmidi.
  In the case of dynamic loading, ROM soundfont should be used:

	% sfxload synthgm

  In the case of static loading, load all the font at this time:

	% sfxload xgdefault.bnk

- Run tkmidi or drvmidi, and enjoy.

	tkmidi *.mid
